# gosample

A sample Go web application deployable to Google's Flexible App Engine. Uses the [echo](https://echo.labstack.com/) library
for the web server for ease of routing requests, logging requests, and handling a production-level volume of requests.

Also provides a sample [request middleware](https://echo.labstack.com/middleware) that would be used
for authentication and authorization.
